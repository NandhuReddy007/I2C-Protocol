# I2C
# INTRODUCTION:
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a synchronous, multi-master/multi-slave serial communication protocol developed by Philips Semiconductor in 1982, widely used today for short-distance communication between microcontrollers and peripheral devices such as sensors and memory chips. Also known as the Two-Wire Interface (TWI), it uses two lines—SCL for clock and SDA for data—in a master-controlled, half-duplex manner, where each slave device has a unique address for communication. I2C combines the advantages of SPI and UART by allowing multiple slaves to connect to a single master like SPI, while also supporting multiple masters managing one or more slaves, making it especially useful for applications such as multiple microcontrollers logging data to a single memory card or displaying text on a common LCD.
# KEY FEATURES:
## 1. Two-Wire Interface
•	Uses SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock) lines.  Transfer of data takes place through SDA while SCL carries the clock signal.
•	This minimizes pin usage and simplifies PCB layout.  
## 2. Master-Slave Architecture
•	One or more masters initiate communication.  
•	Multiple slaves respond based on address matching.  
## 3. Addressing
•	Supports 7-bit addressing scheme.
•	Enables up to 128 (7-bit) unique slave devices.  
## 4. Bi-Directional Data Transfer
•	Open-drain SDA allows both master and slave to drive the line but not simultaneously (HALF-DUPLEX).  
•	Data flows in both directions depending on the R/W bit.  
## 5. Clock Stretching
•	The clock is stretched when the slave device is not ready to accept more data by holding the SCL line low, hence disabling the master to raise the clock line. Master will not be able to raise the clock line because the wires are AND wired and wait until the slave releases the SCL line to show it is ready to transfer next bit.
•	Critical for slow peripherals like sensors or EEPROMs.  
## 6. Multi-Byte Transfers
•	Supports sequential transmission of multiple data bytes.  
•	Each byte followed by ACK/NACK for flow control.  
## 7. Multi-Master Support
•	I2C protocol supports multi-master bus system but more than one bus cannot be used simultaneously.  Arbitration logic ensures only one master controls the bus at a time. If SDA is found high when it was supposed to be low it will be inferred that another master is active and hence stops the transfer of data and resumes once the other master has completed the transfer. 

## 8. Speed Modes
•	Standard Mode: 100 kbps  
•	Fast Mode: 400 kbps  
•	Fast Mode Plus: 1 Mbps  
•	High-Speed Mode: 3.4 Mbps  
•	Ultra-Fast Mode: 5 Mbps (unidirectional)  
## 9. Robust Error Handling
•	ACK/NACK signaling.
•	Arbitration loss detection.  
•	Bus busy detection and collision management.  


# WORKING OF I2C
•	**START Condition**:  START condition is always generated by the controller by pulling the SDA line low while SCL line is high. This signals that a transmission is about to begin and the bus is considered to be busy after START condition.  
•	**Addressing the Slave**: After the START condition, a target address is sent. This address is 7-bit long followed by an eighth bit which is a data direction bit (R/W)- ‘0’ indicates that the controller wants to write to a slave while ‘1’ indicates a request for data from the slave.  
•	**Acknowledge Bit (ACK)/ NOT Acknowledge (NACK)**: The addressed slave device responds by either pulling the SDA line low referring to as ACK or leaving it high referring to as NACK during the next clock pulse.  
•	**Data Transfer**: Depending upon write/read operation master or slave sends 8-bit data, one bit per clock pulse. After each byte the ACK/NACK is sent.
•	Repeated Start (Sr) : Master can issue another START without releasing the bus for combined read/ write.  
•	**STOP Condition**: when the transmission is complete, the master releases SDA line high while SCL is high. These signals indicate the end of communication.

# APPLICATION OF I2C:

•	Communicating with sensors and real-time clocks.  
•	Controlling digital displays and memory chips (EEPROMs).  
•	System management in IoT devices and consumer electronics.
